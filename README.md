# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

In this analysis, we are working with Omar, our new colleague at PyBer. Our assignment is to summarize PyBer's ride sharing data by
city type. Using this data, we can then craft graphs that demonstrate the weekly fares for each city type.

### Purpose

The purpose of this project will be to gather, analyze and chart the ride sharing data from PyBer. Using this analysis, we will
demonstrate the differences in ride sharing across different city types. Following this, we will present on how these differences
can offer insights to the decision-makers at PyBer.

## PyBer Analysis Results

Following the data analysis, we generated the following table which offers some numeric insight into PyBer's business across varying city types.

As we can see in the above table, Pyber is used primarily in urban environments. With 1,625 total rides, 2,405 total drivers and 
$39, 854.38 in fares, urban users account for the largest percentage of PyBer's user base, driver base and revenue. Worthy of note, 
urban environments have the lowest average fare and lowest average fare per driver. This could suggest that the distance driver is typically 
shorter in urban cities, or that the relatively high number of drivers is pushing the cost of the fares downward. That said, it is by far better
to be a rider than a driver in the urban setting.

Following urban environments in every category is suburban. Suburban rides totaled 625, while total drivers came in at 490 and total fares at
$19,356.33. Users in suburban environments averaged $30.97 per ride and drivers earned a fare of $39.50 on average. 

Lastly, we have rural cities. Here, rides only totaled 125, while total drivers came in at 78. Total fares in rural cities only amounted to 
$4,327.93, while riders paid an average fare of $34.62 and drivers earned an average fare of $55.44.

To visualize this data, the following line chart was created to demonstrate, week by week, how PyBer's use across city types changes from
January 2019 to April 2019.

The line graph reflects the data show in the table. By far, urban users account for the lion's share of Pyber's base and revenue. 
Fares for all city types trend upward from January until the end of February before dipping during March. 

## PyBer Analysis Summary and Recommendations

Viewing the data analyzed we can present three distinct business recommendations to the CEO. 

Regarding urban environments, the data shows that PyBer's main user base lays in urban cities with the highest number of rides taken there. 
However, urban environments are the only place in which the average fare surpasses the average fare per driver. Depending on how PyBer pays 
their drivers, they may want to consider increasing the price paid per ride. This could be done by placing a premium on rides
taken in the cities. This could help ensure that driver's are earning a suitable wage for their efforts. This is incredibly important as 
gas, car insurance and cost of living are all more expensive in urban environments. Seeing as there is a clear demand for ride shares in the
cities, this premium could be spread amongst customers at a relatively low cost. While the fare would increase, it would not be marked enough
to risk a dropoff of customer user. 

Another recommendation for urban environments could be to freeze hiring new drivers. At this point, there are more total drivers in urban areas
than there are customers. This surplus of drivers could also be driving down the costs of rides. While this is obectively good for the rider, 
drivers and ultimately PyBer are charging less than is optimal for rides in the urban cities.

For rural cities, PyBer is noticeably lacking compared to other environments. Total rides are low, while the average fare paid is relatively high.
This may be as more people in rural cities have their own means of transportation and rely less on ride shares. In order to capture these customers,
PyBer may wish to consider subsidizing the price of rides to increase their user base in these areas.
